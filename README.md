## Summary

Unsplash is an iOS client test project that uses the unsplash.com api to search and download photos. 

This project has been written in Swift 4.2.

With use of Test Driven Development (TDD) as a developing methodology and by applying Clean Code and the SOLID principles, modular design and high code coverage have been achieved, which enables this test application to scale and perform optimally.
